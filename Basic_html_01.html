    <h1>Tags format the text</h1>
    <p>Tags are used to format the text. like the "heading 1" and "Paraghraph" that I have use here.</p>
    <P>There are many basic tags and several more specialised tags. Browsers will gice default formating for these tags. Additionallu, the web developer may define how some or all these formating trags should be displayed. Also. the user may specify a custom theme (stylesheet) to be used, and this will override both default setting and tose set by the designer.</P>
    
    <h2>Basic tags</h2>
    <p>Headings -- witten h1, h2, ... h6 -- should be familiar from any word processing softaware. Similarly, paragraphs (p). Only important part:
    <string>Remember to exit (close) any tag!</string> That is the forwars-slash tag, as in /p.</p>
    <p>There are several more formating tags, For example <em>emphasis italics</em>
    and <strong>strong/ bold/ fat</strong> text.</p>
    
    <p>The most important principle, is <strong><em>consistency</em></strong>. You must use tags consistenly and ensure, for example, that you never follow a H1 with a H3 without a H2 inbetween. More in that later. </p>
    
    <h1>Tags defines text and layout</h1>
    <p>Then there are tags to make text clearly seperate from the rest. For example we use <code>&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; when we need a weapper for code/ script/ tags that should not be executed but displayed as</code> on the webpage.</p>
    
    <p>We have tags for ordered and unordered list (&lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt;).</p>
    <p>I use Atome instead of IntelliJ because:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I didn't get hold of a license key before summer and</li>
        <li>I don't know how to make the text BIG in IntelliJ</li>
    </ol>
