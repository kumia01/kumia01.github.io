            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
                The challenge we were presented by the Save the Children is as follows. <br/>
                We are facing an education emergency. Millions of children might not return to school, drop out or not be enrolled at all. <br/>
                Save the Children needs input and innovative thoughts on how we can improve the work with education management systems to <br/>
                ensure children's right for education is fullfilled. </p>
                <hr/>
           <q>How can attendance and enrolement data prevent dropout in school? How can technology play a role in solving this issue?</q>

                <!--Hentet fra presentasjonsnotater--><br/>
                Our inspiration lies within basic human rights. Free primary education is a human right, and secondary education should be available to all. <br/>
                We wish to provide a certain level of security in vulnerable regions. Intuitive way of collecting data to make the process easier. <br/>Focusing on incentives and prevention thru the collected data instead of punishment. Relatively cheap technology that ensures easy installment and use.<br/>  Easy access ensures intuitive use – forms a habit of scanning the card. Reward system based on attendance data to keep kids coming to school. <br/><br/> Competition points based on collected data to give kids hope for future education and work. Provide a certain level of security inside the school thru the access card. Benefits for the parents based on collected data, an incentive for the parents to keep their kids in school.
