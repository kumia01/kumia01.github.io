            <p1>Keycard is an incentive-based solution meant towards keeping children in impoverished countries in school. Research shows that the benefits of education never materialize for most children in impoverished regions. Our solution is to materialize and give real hope for improvement.  </p1>

            <h1>Problem</h1>
            <p1>
                The challenge we were presented by the Save the Children is as follows. <br/>
                We are facing an education emergency. Millions of children might not return to school, drop out or not be enrolled at all. <br/>
                Save the Children needs input and innovative thoughts on how we can improve the work with education management systems to <br/>
                ensure children's right for education is fullfilled. </p1>
                <br>
           <br><q><i>How can attendance and enrolement data prevent dropout in school? How can technology play a role in solving this issue?</i></q>

                <!--Hentet fra presentasjonsnotater--><br/>
               We wish to give hope for a better future by showing the possibilities of education. Counting attending days and rewarding the parents<br> who keep their children in school. The reward is mainly a future work-place promise.
